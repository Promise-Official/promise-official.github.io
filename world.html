		<p> <em> Promise </em> is set in a fantasy world, so setting isn't as simply defined as "London, 1975", or anything of the like. <em> Promise's </em> world has all been handcrafted and designed. Some of it might get confusing when reading it in the book, or perhaps you just want to know a few extra facts that weren't mentioned at all. Either way, you've come to the right place.


			<h3> Location </h3>


			<img id="symbol" src="/images/symbol.png">

		<p class="wa"> They live on a large island broke up into five segments, which are known as the five regions. The country is called by its inhabitants Elipsum-Ckye. They are hidden from the rest of earth through a strange portal between realms. They know of other countries, but have no relations to them (Calak mentions America in chapter 4). Other countries do not know they exist.

		<p class="wa"> In the simpliest of terms, they exist on a different realm, but same world (if that makes any sense). In other words, their whole island is an anomaly that cannot be seen by sailors. To passers by, it may look like a perfect reflection of watery expanse. To others, it may look like a dense cloud of smoke that whispers eerily to them. No person sees the coastlione the same, and because of this, many people refuse to sail in that part of the ocean. Those who do not know about it cannot find it, and those who leave have a small chance of finding it again unless they know how the coastline appears to them. It is referred to as the Phantasm Effect in their country.

		<p> People who have ventured into the realm often struggle to remember how they got there. Once they leave once more, they may search for but will likely not find it again. Visitors to Elipsum-Ckye are so rare that they are often officially documented within the palace as monumental historical events.


			<h3> Magic System </h3>


		<p> Magic on Elipsum-Ckye is not very common. In fact, only one being can naturally produce magic and utilize it. This being, often donned with the title of Spellbound for both their ethereal beauty and for their existance being bound to magic. They are born every millennia, and fade away when a new one is born. They cannot co-exist and there will never be more than one present in the world. Their purpose is to protect the country of Elipsum-Ckye from demonic creatures of shadows that have been banished from the rest of the world. Many speculate why they were and if the island was created purely for the fact, but no one knows for sure. Spellbounds were sent after a cry for help by the people of Elipsum-Ckye. 

		<p> Spellbounds use magic to disperse of the dangerous shadows in their own unique ways. Vision, the first Spellbound, created flames. Eira manipulates the atmosphere and in turn, the sunlight (and the sunlight reflected off the moon as well). It depends on preference and ease of the individual. However, all Spellbounds can manipulate and create any of the elements, and they often learn to use them in abstract ways. They have control of heat and cold (molecular speed), earth, wind, and water, along with electricity and gravity, despite the two not being elements. They can make fire with earth and heat or ice with water and cold.

		<p> Spellbounds’ families are usually unknown, as birthing Spellbounds usually kills the mother, and the father is typically killed by the magic of a Spellbound when they are young. Most frequently, a Junip will take over the care of the Spellbound. Mattley Verzte was the one to take care of the last and only five Spellbounds, including Eira. Because of this, a last name is usually not used on Spellbounds, but technically they do have one.

		<p> However, there is another form of natural magic called Sight. Spellbounds possess it naturally, but periodically, a human may also be born with it. The shadow demons, to the naked human eye, are no more than shadows. Sight is the ability to see the shadows as the true monstrous forms they are on this land. This phenomenon happens almost every hundred years, but is not always guarunteed. Those with Sight often get light blue highlights to their hair congenitally.

		<p> Magic on a human is extremely dangerous when they are not built to withstand it. They would most assuredly die, but there is a ritual to ensure their survival. This usually involves the killing of either human or specific animals to take the place of the death the human would have had to endure. However, this, if performed regularly, would result in immortality. People call this form of magic black magic or Junipary (practicers of Junipary are called Junips).
 

			<h3> Government and Economy </h3>


		<p> It effectively runs as a monarchy style of government. Spellbounds typically have the final say in dealings within the country, however, each region have its own "demi-reoyal" that takes care of day-to-day things and simply reports to the Spellbound or request their help with matters when needed. These demi-royals are often elected by people but must be approved by the Spellbound. They run for as long as the people or the Spellbound want them too (they can also resign if wanted), but Spellbound's instruction or popular vote can remove them.

		<p> There are three official Demi-royals in Elipsum-Ckye for each region aside from the Central Kingdom which the Spellbound directly rules over and the Western Crest. Mattley Verzte is considered by Eira and the other Junips of the Western Crest as the unofficial Demi-royal of the Western Crest, despite him never showing up to royal meetings or reporting to Eira as often.

		<p> Trade is a large part of Elipsum-Ckye, and is often preferred over straight currency to good exchange. They operate on a coin system with only one value. The E-Ckyan coin is worth the equivalent to about $15 USD, $20 CAD, €13 EUR, £11 GBP, or $21 AUD. Anything worth under a single coin is usually sold in pairs or groups until it equals a single coin. Rounding up or down is extremely common. Flawed, yes, but how their society works. 

		<P> Money isn’t as big of a deal to them as much as trading services and goods is. Working a full 9-hour shift would only get five coins, six if you’re a good employee, and seven if it’s a really high end job and you’re a fantastic employee. Most businesses, however, exchange their own goods or services and only give three coins.


			<h3> Regions and Landmarks </h3>


		<img id="regions" src="/images/regions.jpg">

		<p> The five regions of Elpsum-Ckye vary in landscape, culture, among other things. Here are brief descriptions of each region and the landmarks within them:


		<p> <strong> Central Kingdom </strong>
		  <br> Big city/marketplace. Where Eira’s palace is, Calak primarily works, and the main city is. Most commerce is run through the Central Kingdom. People of all kinds live here.

		<p> The palace is Eira's main base of operations, and her staff also lives there. It has two main floors and an accessible roof area. The first floor consists of the main rooms such as a ballroom, dining hall, kitchen, library, etc. while the second floor mostly has the sleeping chambers. Royalty and important figures/guests stay on the west wing, and staff stay on the east wing. Eira is on a loft that is the only resemblance of a third floor.

		<p> The Central Kingdom also contains the marketplace, which is the biggest place of commerce in the entire country. If anyone needs anything, they are likely to find it in the marketplace.
 
		<p> <strong> Eastern Reaches </strong> 
		   <br> Desert wasteland. Split in the Northeastern and Southeastern areas that are almost constantly in war with each other. Mostly comprised of gun hunters and soldiers.

		<p> Both the headquarters for the Northeast and the Southeast are on opposite sides of the Eastern Reaches. The military academy is also there.

		<p> <strong> Southern Plateau </strong> 
		   <br> Grassy plains with clear rivers. The hotspot for growing crops and raising animals. Calm place to live. Mostly farmers and country folk live here and is a large part of food and animal product exports.

		<p> The Orchards which supply many of the countries fruits and vegetables, along with eggs and dairy products. It is run and owned by the demi-royal of the Southern Plateau and his wife.
 
		<p> <strong> Western Crest </strong> 
		   <br> Dense rainforests and rocky beaches. Most Junips reside here, so people tend to stay away from the area, even if it’s a safe place to live for the most part.
 
		<p> <strong> The North Lands </strong> 
		   <br> Frozen tundra. Very few people live there, but they export a lot of furs and wood. Living there is often described as having a death wish. Calak calls it “A necessity for an architect like myself, but to live there would be foolish in every aspect. I hold the greatest respect for those who brave that place.”


			<h3> Climate  </h3>


		<p> The country is anomalous in more ways than just the Phantasm Effect. Despite only being 8,986m² (roughly close to the size of New Hampshire or Vermont in the USA or the country of Djibouti), the weather varies immensely. For reference, here is a chart of average temperatures and general climate:

		<div id="table">
			<br>
			<table>
				<tr> <th>Region</th> <th>Avg. Winter Temp</th> <th>Avg. Summer Temp</th> <th>Avg. Climate</th> </tr>

				<tr> <th>Central Kingdom</th> <td>23-46&deg;F</td> <td>69-83&deg;F</td> <td>Windy, infrequent rain, part. sunny</td> </tr>
				<tr> <th>Southern Plateau</th> <td>60-72&deg;F</td> <td>79-95&deg;F</td> <td>Sunny, frequent rain</td> </tr>
				<tr> <th>Western Crest</th> <td>29-54&deg;F</td> <td>71-88&deg;F</td> <td>Rainy, humid</td> </tr>
				<tr> <th>The North Lands</th> <td>(-13)-(5)&deg;F</td> <td>29-41&deg;F</td> <td>Frigid, cloudy, frequent snowstorms</td> </tr>
				<tr> <th>Eastern Reaches</th> <td>76-97&deg;F Day; <br>37-55&deg;F Night</td> <td>84-112&deg;F Day; <br>42-60&deg;F Night</td> <td>Dry, hot 				days and cold nights </td> </tr>
			</table>
		</div> <!--end of table-->
		
		<p> You may be wondering if their fauna and/or flora are just as anamolous as the rest of the country... nope! It's pretty much the same as other places in that regard. Architect has a Ragdoll cat, Calak uses a Clydesdale horse n chapter 1, Common Rocky Columbines are mentioned a few times, Calak and Eira drank Chrysanthemum and Chanomile tea in ch 1 and 6, respectively, and the list goes on. 


			<h3> Technology </h3>


		<p> While their technology and manner of speech would infer an 18th century- at most a 20th century- setting, but it actually takes place in 2020s. Due to not having many connections with the rest of the world, their technology has not advanced nearly as fast, nor has their language. 

		<p> They have no motorized vehicles. They only have (river) boats, horse and carriages, and their own legs. They have forms of electricity, such as light and plumbing, but AC is not a thing. However, they have ceiling fans and fireplaces to compensate. They have modern-style guns such as assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, and pistols, but they do not have any atomic weapons or tanks.

		<p> Computers or phones are non existant. Radios have come around recently and are used to speak across the country. Urgent messages are sent via radio, otherwise they arrive through letters. They can connect to other countries' frequencies, but cannot send messages. Many contribute this phenomenon to the Phantasm Effect.

		<p> It isn’t that they can’t get modern inventions, as they have the knowledge and materials to do so, they simply don’t want to. The people of Elipsum-Ckye value hard work, and would rather only invent what they need, not what’s convenient. 


			<h3> Culture </h3>

		<img id="whoops" src="/images/money.jpg">

		<p class="wa"> Because of their lack of connection from other countries, their culture has never yet been influenced by other cultures. However, humans are human and are bound to eventually come to similar conclusions. Chivalry is a common practice, however, it is not called chivalry to them.

		<p class="wa"> It is a social standard that Spellbounds remain single and focus entirely on keeping the island of Elipsum-Ckye safe since this is what Vision did. Spellbounds are likewise expected not to care much for themselves and to be entirely selfles in every regard, especially because they do not require sustenance to survive.

		<p class="wa"> The people of Elipsum-Ckye value hard work in every aspect of life, whether it be in a job, relationship, family, education, or anything in between. However, it is fairly common that this virtue be taken to an extreme, making burnout the most common mental ailment rather than anxiety or depression.

		<p> Trade is a very important thing to people in Elipsum-Ckye and is preferred over straight currency-to-goods trade. Using coins to pay is usually considered rude unless you do not have anything they are willing to take as a trade (which, depending on the day and individual, might be common).

		<p> Only royals (which includes demi-royals) and royal workers wear earrings. They aren’t required to but it acts as a status symbol. They are usually far more complex than the earrings in our everyday life, and always made from solid metal. This alone makes it harder for people to get them.


			<h3> Language </h3>


		<p> They speak English or Latin for the most part, often mimicking what we would call "old style English". However, some time back, they used a code called Ashenight. It is traditionally a phantom symbol system, but Elipsum-Ckye has used it instead of English lettering for hundreds of years before it inexplicably died away and was replaced with English lettering once again. 

		<p> It came to Elipsum-Ckye because a few phantoms about three thousand years ago visited when they felt the magical presence of Vision, and taught the code to the people there. Phantoms have not visited since. No one documented this event, either, so they do not realize it is a phantom code.

		<p> Not many people still know Ashenight- mostly scholars or really, really bored people. Some of the lettering can still be found on old ruins, the country's symbol, or old coins.
