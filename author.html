			<p style="width:81%"> Myu Ether. Yeah, it’s a pseudonym. Well, it’s actually my persona (there’s no shame in looking it up if need be. I know I had 			to). This isn’t about her, though. It’s about me- the real life me. Rereading that makes me sound selfish, but you’ll see what I’m getting at soon. 

			<p> Anyway, I'll talk about Myu In a minute. Right now, I want to explain why I am writing <em>  Promise. </em>

			<h3> The Reason for it all </h3>

			<p> It started small, it always does: just a short story where I tried to emulate the writing style of Robert Jordan, author of The Wheel of Time. 			Then I realized it kind of became my magnum opus. It was the thing I would point to whenever anyone asked to read my work. I began to consider it 			more deeply, flesh out the characters (who were just Calak and Eira at the time), envision them as people. It started with A New Promise, which is 			now chapter nine out of twenty-two. Then I made A Remaining Promise, followed immediately by A Tested Promise. At this point I did not consider it a 			book yet. It wasn’t until I wrote the next story a few months later, A Broken Promise, that I started to consider making it into something bigger, 			something more cohesive and meaningful. 

			<p> I dropped everything I was working on and immediately began pumping out chapters, chronologically this time. I hit a small burnout around chapter 			13, as you can probably imagine after writing a full chapter every two weeks with no breaks and juggling real life stuff. I took a few weeks off, 			then reminded myself it wasn’t as big as I was making it. It was supposed to be fun to create and meaningful to read, not messily thrown together 			because I felt like I absolutely <em> had </em> to write an entire 300-something page book before moving not even a year later. I got back into a 			swing, and I’d say this is where I got my big idea. 

			<p> I’m a fiercely devoted Christian, and I hope to think that this is evident through my writing and my characters. I had originally planned to make 			the book not brush on the topic past fleeting mentions, but I realized the hole I was digging myself in doing that. I was consumed by writing this 			book and without God dwelling in it, it became an idol. 

			<p> So I got the idea to make it about God. Not in a loud, in-your-face-constantly kind of way, but I subtly begin to drop deeper moments of gospel 			truth. I dropped hints of metaphors, and I started making the characters have different relationships with God (some of my biggest inspirations for 			those was in the seed parable in Matthew 13, and the stories of my friends). I tried made God evident in how the characters developed: Architect’s 			redemption, Calak’s revival, Quintan’s realignment, Fathíma’s discovery, and Eira’s trust fall. 

			<p> With this recent, subtle yet undeniably Biblical shift I have put to quite a few of the chapters, I feel that I grew closer to the Lord through 			it. Especially since my new end goal with the book was to lure people in with story, then hint at what true salvation and Christianity is like by the 			end. I am hoping those who struggle will find that this book might call them out just like Quintan was called out for his incorrect faith, or those 			who do not believe at all will begin to see the appeal. I do not advertise it as Christian for that reason because people looking for a Christian 			book will be disappointed at the infrequent mentions of Jesus and those who don’t want anything to do with it would likely turn away immediately. I 			think I see this book as a wonderful Gospel opportunity: a way to remind or even introduce the real Gospel truth to my readers without being as a lot 			of people would feel as “overbearing”.  

			<p> Let me be 100% honest here: this isn’t me trying to manipulate or shove God down people’s throats. If they don’t want to hear it, then they can 			easily set the book down and walk away. But I’m sincerely praying that this book reaches the people who do- the ones that are unsure, the ones that 			are curious yet cautious, the ones who are afraid. I want to reach out to them with a message: Jesus is there for you, no matter what you’ve done, 			where you are, how far you've run or hid. He loves you dearly and paid an unfathomable price for you. It’s not about the rules, the do’s and don’ts; 			All it takes is a little trust, and the rest will follow. 

			<p> <em> That </em> is what I hope readers see. 

			<p> <em> That </em> is the reason I am persevering till the end. 

			<p> <em> That </em> is the reason for <em> Promise. </em>


			<h3> Myu Ether </h3>

			<img id="myu_ether" src="/images/myu.jpg">

			<p class="wawa"> Imagine a being detached from reality; wandering alternate planes, visiting other worlds- fantasy and historical alike- always 			leaving small pieces of it behind for others to find. This being is far from human, living as its own kind who wanders to tell stories of many worlds 			it has experienced. No one can put a name to this creature, but many may try. Alien, apparition, divine messanger, the titles never cease. 		

			<p class="wawa"> Many try to know this ethereal being, but most cannot comprehend its fluid motions, how it sees yet remains blindfolded, how it 			creates magic even in non magical worlds, or how its words only echo faintly like the wind. Others simply determine that it isn't a creature meant to 			be understood, but rather a being simply meant to be listened to, existing for the sole purpose to share its stories before leaving once more.

			<p class="wawa"> Some worlds it may revisit, others it would rather soon forget. But it continues to travel through worlds, sharing stories, 				learning skills, and leaving behind a remnant memory of itself.

			<p class="wawa"> It calls itself Myu Ether, the ethereal wanderer.


			<h3> A Little More About Me </h3>


			<ul>
			  <li> Is it pronounced My-u or Mew? </li>
				<p> Mew. Myu. One syllable, like the sound a cat makes.

			  <li> What is your stance on AI? </li>
				<p> I think it has it's place... but people forget that place. Under no circumstances, if it takes from other people's jobs and/or completes 				tasks you were specifically asked to do (school papers, work reports, etc.), do I think it's ok. I will never use AI for art or to do my work 				for me. You can rest assured that none of <em> Promise </em> has been made by AI. That being said, however, do I use AI to help with grammar 				and spelling checks? Yes, I do. Do I think there are places and aspects that AI can greatly help humanity as a whole? Yes. Am I ok with 				people minimizing people's jobs or hard work with a single prompt? Absolutely not! 

			<p>
			   <li> What is your biggest pet peeve when it comes to writing? </li>
				<p> When I start telling people about my <em> fantasy </em> world, and they start trying to make me make it more realisitic. Well, I guess it 				kind of bothers me when they refuse to focus on anything but the potential plotholes (oftentimes they just don't understand what I'm saying 				because I can't explain it well). It drives me crazy. As much as I like questions and critique, I find it exhausting walking into a 					conversation excited to share my creation only to be spending the next twenty minutes trying to explain that it is a magical fantasy world, 				and the whole point of why some things "don't make sense" (like the phantasm effect) is because they are meant to be anomalies. Maybe I just 				need to work on my patience and sensitivity...

			  <p>
			 <li> What inspired Promise? </li>
				<p> Be honest, did you read the section about the reason for it all? No shame if not, but it is pretty good. Anyway, Robert Jordan's <em> 				Wheel of Time. </em> Actually, I didn't even finish chapter one before getting to work, so it was more his writing style than the actual 				story. But I did base a little of A New Promise off of the prologue.

			<p>
			  <li> Who does the art for the website and/or book? </li>
				<p> KG Graphic Studios.... which is actually also me but that's a secret so <em> shhhh. </em>

			<p>
			  <li> What made you get into writing? </li>
				<p> I don't think there was one, definative moment where I decided that I like writing. It's always just been there. Most of my young 					childhood was just playing pretend with or as my own charaxcters in my own fantasy worlds. I never grew out of that phase. My first "book" 				was written when I was probably 9 or 10. It was called Lisa and Her Adventures, and was about a girl named Lisa and her sister Liza. It 				was all handwritten on stapled, folded paper with a purple construction paper cover. I know, it sounds bad, but I was proud of it and I just 				remember begging my mom to let me read it to her over the kitchen counter I could barely reach.
			<p>
			   <li> Do you have other books or stories written or published? </li>
				<p> None are published, but I do have five other books and about eight or so short stories (not all of them are fully completed). Most of the 				short stories were just brief little tidbits of other worlds I created or fanfaction from games I just thought were pretty cool. One book is 				from when I was 11 or 12, and is printed. It's an Undeertale fanfiction written by a literal child, so you can probably imagine how that is. 				And the other is a compilation of 10 short stories within the same world. The other three books were never finished but they got pretty far 				in developement before I either lost interest or realized my plot had so many holes it wasn't worth continuing. Most of them half like 9-15 				chapters done (wait, that sounds fam- ...uh oh).

			<p>
			   <li> Are you <em> sure </em> you're going to finish <em> Promise? </em> </li>
				<p> I am 91.7% sure. I think it's the first story I really stepped back and thought hard about before committing blindly. I have the whole 				story mapped out and some of my friends and family have helped me flesh out the niche details of the world to keep major plot holes from 				slipping in. Plus, I think this is my favorite story I've made so far.

			<p> Here's some goofy questions too :)

			   <li> In your opinion, what's the most funny word in the English language? </li>
				<p> Gobsmacked. Smacked by a gob?? It's just so goofy.

			   <li> What's a niche joke that probably only you find funny? </li>
				<p> "Bro ur such a gek relic." My sibling and I were playing No Man's Sky and there is a race called the Gek, which you can find their old 				relics. My sibling pointed out how it sounded like an insult, and thus that joke was born. I think the only times it gets laughs is because 				I'm chuckling and they just don't get it so they awkward laugh too. Y'all know the laugh: "heh heh.. what?"

			   <li> What's a weird habit you have? </li>
				<p> I talk to myself. Not the way most people do it, like they kind of work through what they have to do out loud or ask themselves a 					question like "what was I doing again?". No, I have full conversations with myself, weather smalltalk and all, but mostly roleplays. I've 				been given weird looks before, too. It's pretty great.
