			<p> Calak Perthran had never been a confident individual. The constant verbal harassment from peers causing him to believe his congenital condition to see shadow demons is really only schizophrenia ensured that. He kept his head down through college, yet it wasn’t enough to keep him completely unnoticed. The magic-blessed Queen Eira herself had taken notice of his brilliance and enlisted him as her royal architect. Their friendship blossomed, and they became each other's safe haven. However, a black magic user desired the limitless power of the queen for their own and recklessly attempted to steal it. Unforeseen circumstances turned to what could be the end of the world with only the unlikely duo, along with some trusted allies, to fix it.

			<p class="wawawa"> <em> Promise </em> is a dystopian fantasy (with a hint of romance) novel authored by Myu Ether as a passion project. This site exists for the purpose of both sharing her love for this project and to encourage others alongside her journey to finish and publish this book. Here, you can find information on the book and its author, the world, the characters, and look forward to the weekly updates on progress. Thank you for being here; you help make this dream project a reality!  </p>

			<p class="wawawa"> To the right of here is the weekly news. On Monday morning of each week, if I can, I will publish an update on the progress of the book. I currently list which week update it is (1 was the first published weekly news not the first week of starting <em> Promise </em>). Note that this will include both writing and art updates. </p>

			<p style="margin-left:100px"> Happy reading! 
			<br/> Love, Myu </p>

			<p> I finally finihsed chapter 15 wooooo! And it <em> only </em> took me almost a month! To get in the mood for writing, I've been listening to the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/fantasy-lofi/1609757467" target="blank">Fantasy Lofi</a> album by Blurred. They've got nice, lofi music to fit many different fantasy scenarios, so it kinda gets me in the writing spirit.

			<p> Now, time to procrastinate on chapter 16 >:3

			<p> That aside, I've been really working hard on this site, so there's now every page but the characters page done! Which, as much as I wish it would be fast, it's going to take me a very long time. After all, I have to make a full body artwork of <strong> ten </strong> characters. Not even to mention all the bios and stuff I have to write before then coding it into this website. 

			<p> It's safe to say I have my work cut out for me. Anyway, that's all for now. Until next time, friends!
