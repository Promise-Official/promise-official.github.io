			<p> I want to give people a proper preview of what I've been working on without spoiling too much of the story for those who want it still be a surprise but also want to get a 			good feel of my writing style and/or the book itself. I also did not want to simply submit my entire book online because half of the exprience is how the physical book will be 			formatted, the art I plan to integrate, among other things. 

			<p> My best way to solve both sides was to simply give you chapter one before final edits. Things may be subject to change, but this is <em> likely </em> the finished product. 			That being said, if there are any grammar mistakes... rest in the knowledge I will likely catch it when I go through the entire book three to four times before having it 				printed. You can also email me with any thoughts or critiques. 

			<p> A quick foreword, if I may. Chapter 1 jumps between every region except The North Lands (which are not mentioned much in the story) to give you a taste of later segments to 			come. It introduces nameless characters in each region as a taste of what those areas are like before finishing in the Central Kingdom with Calak and Eira. 

			<p class="warning"> <strong> WARNING: if you are triggered by mild and/or brief descriptions of war, blood, death, bullying, or mental instability/illnesses- includng but not 				limited to: panic attacks, physical assault, death and/or dying, and war conditions- this book contains elements of all of these. </strong>

		<h3> Chapter 1 - A World's Promise </h3>


		<p style="text-align:center"> 1 </p>


			<p> Gunshots and screams of desperation echoed through barren valleys and hills incessantly. Nothing but sand and the bodies of fallen soldiers could be seen over seemingly indefinite stretches of war plagued land. Rest was a foreign concept, as was peace. 

	<p> Two sides were incessantly in altercation with each other, with neither securing any leverage. The infrequent times of peace lasted no longer than a few hours before war broke out once again. The Northeast and the Southeast, two opposites that were believed to never have heart to show benevolence. Those of the other kingdoms would never take part in choosing sides audibly- even if they did internally- and, likewise, never traveled the border of the Eastern Reaches for fear of getting a dozen bullets shot through their bodies with horrifying accuracy. Many in the Eastern Reaches spoke on repeat like a mantra, “Anyone who doesn’t bear our color is no better alive than dead, and more likely better off on the floor with no beat in their chest.” 

	<p> Those who picked a side often chose the Southeast, backing their opinion with how they showed evidence of more magnanimity than the ever self-serving Northeast. The Demi-royal of the Eastern Reaches has worked tirelessly to become an idol, practically a deity of his own to those of the Northeast. The Southeast thought nothing more of Theron Pilott than a foolish narcissist who never ought to have come into power. They chose to fight against it. Albeit no one could have predicted the utter disarray that would soon follow such a decision. 

	<p> Near the beginning of this tumultuous event, many tried to assist in peace bringing, yet none succeeded. Not even the ethereal Queen Eira could convince them to cease their quarrels. After many lethal incidents those of the east purported as collateral damage, the people of the other kingdoms stopped in their attempts to mitigate the undoubtedly inevitable situation.

	<p> A tall, broad man, bred in the confines of war much like the rest of this generation of soldiers, quickly sifted through contents of various storage crates within a bunker. Two of his fellow soldiers stood beside him, guarding his blind spots faithfully. Each of them adorned lavender colors, thus proving their allegiance to the Southeast in this indefinite war. 

	<p> His eyes flicked back to the soldier on his right as she spoke in a hushed tone, simply musing her thoughts out in the thick, dusty air, “As much as I certainly love the thrill of scouring enemy camps for supplies, infrequent times of rest in our land would be pleasant, no? Like the other kingdoms, who hardly have to worry about waltzing with death most every day.”

	<p> The left soldier quietly contemplated his co-worker’s words before humoring her with a response, “I realize where your train of thought originated, and I likewise agree to some extend. An infrequent peaceful getaway would be preferable. However, complaining won’t get us much of anywhere.”

	<p> The man stashed rations into a bag while boldly voicing his opinion, “I strongly disagree. Those in the other kingdoms are weak. Vulnerable, even. They cannot handle a light threat, the North Lands being an exception. It’s better we’re constantly facing danger. A tranquil break would throw us into a spiral of insufficiency- it’d be nothing more than a distraction. I’d rather feel the adrenaline everyday; I’d rather fight everyday.”

	<p> Feeling bitter from such a stinging response to innocent fantasies, the soldier retorted, “And yet you fight your own family everyday… heartlessly.”

	<p> The man rose swiftly, coercing silence from them through intimidation, “Shut it. They chose their side, and I chose mine. I’d sooner die than fight for anyone but God’s glory.”

	<p> In a soft mutter, all too quiet for the burly man to hear, the leftmost solder spoke, “We really ought not to be fighting at all.”

	<p> Immediately, the man turned on a heel and strode out of the bunker. He pushed the bag of stolen rations into the man’s arms, claiming he would remain at his usual sniping perch. The woman to the right, who had been spectating this exchange, softly beckoned out, “I apologize for causing reason for bicker.”

	<p> But the man ignored her words. The ordeal was over and already out of his mind. Life had to move fast for those in the Eastern Reaches. No time for thought or rest, not when your life was at stake every waking moment.

	<p> He climbed and traversed his way to his customary sniping position, hidden within tall rocks. His gaze immediately fell on a pair of soldiers bearing the color green across their thin armoring. He grinned wickedly as they came up into range, the adrenaline he has grown to love pumping through his veins once more like fire.


		<p style="text-align:center"> 2 </p>


	<p> The sun shone lustrously over the placid plains of the Southern Plateau, making for conditions most would claim as perfect for the day’s work on a farm. A young woman spent her morning tilling land, harvesting berries, and caring for her many animals. 

	<p> As she diligently bundled wheat with her calloused hands under the shade of her shed, a scene before her caught her notice. A neighboring farmer had stopped nearby, examining the rickety wheel of his cart. A precariously balanced mountain of hay threatened to fall from his wagon as he crouched by the wheel, inspecting and prodding at it with a furrowed brow.

	<p> She ceased her work momentarily to approach the man, opening the gate to her property and standing a few feet away. “G’day, sir, something the matter?” She queried respectfully, folding her hands together in front of her as her vermillion eyes curiously swept over the wheel he was inspecting.

	<p> “Afternoon,” the man replied gruffly, but politely. “I reckon my wheel’s loose. Any longer down the road, and it’ll pop off, sending my fresh hay into the dirt for me to deal with for the next five hours.” He muttered disconcertedly, lightly tapping the wheel with the back of his hand.

	<p> “Broken ball bearin'?” She guessed. His nod confirmed her suspicions. “No worries, sir, I got spares; I can get one for ya,” she spoke in her rapid voice. Those who converse with her often say she talks too fast and never seems to need to breathe between sentences. Though she never saw their point.

	<p> Without waiting for a response, she turned swiftly on a heel and trotted back to her shed. She shuffled through all of the compartments, finding the very thing she needed. After fixing his wheel and waving him off, she heard a familiar ring echo across the farm. She grinned and waltzed back to the farmhouse across the acres of land, opening the door and toeing off her boots before walking in. 

	<p> “Good afternoon, papa,” she said in passing to an older man sitting on a large, cushioned chair. The newspaper in his hands immediately struck her attention, her eyes noticing the sketch of a murder scene. The first word that caught her attention was “Killjoy”. She had heard of the psychopath before. Unpredictable, sly, and uncatchable, murdering nearly every fourth night in the Central Kingdom for a nigh decade. Not much was known about him aside from his pseudonym Killjoy and his love for leaving bloody messages at every crime scene. It was such stories that made the lady glad she resided in the calm Southern Plateau. 

	<p> “Hello, my dear daughter,” the man replied lovingly, his smile creasing his face with wrinkles as he met her gaze with kind eyes. “Your mother has your dinner prepared in the kitchen.”

	<p> She nodded her thanks, making way to the kitchen where her mother already had a plate filled with warm food sitting on the counter. “Hi, my love, how’s the farm today?” Her mother beckoned sweetly. “Additionally, Elipsum-Ckye University sent a letter. They’re interested in you attending.”

	<p> “Farm is well, and no thank you, momma. I’d feel far too worried for leaving you and papa here alone- who would care for the farm? Besides, I’m already past average age to attend, and it would be awkward,” the girl replied, taking the edges of the ceramic plate in her hands. 

	<p> Her mother sighed but reluctantly gave in and gently pecked her daughter’s cheek. “I only want the best for you. You know that, right?”

	<p> “Of course, momma, but y’know I like farm work. It’s rewarding, and it keeps me active,” she retorted softly. “I love you,” she added soon after as she took her food and walked out of the kitchen. She passed by her father again, pausing in her tracks when she noticed he finished reading the newspaper. “Could I borrow that, papa?” When he agreed, she tucked the papyrus sheets under her arm and walked to the attic stairs. 

	<p> Ascending, she opened the door, setting her food on a petite vanity. Her smile fell as she quickly tore out the desired article from the newspaper. The whiteboard on the right of the door was adorned with tasks categorized by day, week, or month. She hooked her hand under the bottom ledge and spun it around. Scattered across the opposite side were myriads of newspaper articles, photos, and other things all relating to Killjoy and his murders. Some were interconnected by red string, others solitary.

	<p> “I will find you, Killjoy,” she muttered to herself as she put the article up with a magnet, “no matter how cunning you think you are.” She paced in front of the board, only pausing occasionally to take a bite of her dinner. She mumbled through all her notes on him aloud to herself, “Never goes to one place twice in a row, adores leavin’ riddles and ambiguous clues in blood on the walls of his murder scenes, leaves the mess but never any traces, never has a distinct pattern to his locations... that we know of. This is a game to him, and I’m willin’ to play.”

	<p> Her eyes dart across the board. Each location somewhere in the Central Kingdom, even if close to the border. None of them were connected in any logical way. Nothing tied them together. One night there was a murder done by his hand in one sub area, merely three days later he could be nowhere near his original position with a murder of his staining the headlines once more. She wondered impatiently “does he never sleep?!”

	<p> She huffed exasperatedly, falling back on her rickety bed. Her head turned to the side, catching glance of the drawer on her nightstand. She slowly hoisted herself up, opened the drawer, setting her eye on a silver, resplendent dagger. The handle was intricately carved with roses, vines, and thorns. Decorating the bottom was three symbols in Ashenight, the ancient language of generations who passed and whose knowledge was slowly lost. The sharp blade twisted once around to the tip and was forever stained with dark splatters. She carefully picked up the weighty blade, whispering as if she were speaking to him directly, “I have something of your’s, Killjoy-”

	<p> “-and I want to return it to you.”


 		<p style="text-align:center"> 3 </p>


	<p> Little light passed through the canopies of the Western Crest. The fog was thick, concealing the dense rainforest in darkness. Only an inhabitant could navigate the dark forest, for an excursionist would surely get lost. Not that anyone dared visit the Western Crest. Only Junips, black magic users, resided there due to its abundance of fauna and flora.

	<p> Though, deep into the darkness and through the fog was a small cottage. Inside, a Junip sat on a pillow on the floor beside his apprentice. His eyes were gently shut as he took long, deep breaths. A tea table was set with a steaming kettle, two cups, and a bowl of finely grained sugar.

	<p> “With all due respect, sir… when might we get to learning Junipary?” The young apprentice questioned impatiently, holding her teacup tightly. Her teacher insisted many times to slow her persistence in learning everything so fast, yet her excitement was uncontainable. 

	<p> He sighed softly, opening his eyes. “You are being impatient again, my apprentice. Learning Junipary is a long road, and it isn’t always straight. Likewise, it’s hardly a moral road. You must contemplate and appreciate life fully before being so set to end it prematurely.”

	<p> “You speak in riddles to me,” the young woman retorted, taking a sip of her tea.

	<p> He smiled, “Then simply relax. You will get to where you desire to be eventually.”

	<p> Their conversation was cut short by the sound of a knock on the door, a rarity in of itself in the Western Crest. The man rose to his feet, gliding to the front door of his cottage. Upon opening, a knight of the royal guard stood in erect attention. “A letter from the queen of Elipsum-Ckye,” they spoke firmly, holding out a wax sealed parchment. Despite their collected tone, their hand shook with apprehension as they held out the letter.

	<p> “Thank you. And extend my appreciations to the queen,” the man replied, giving a bow of his head and benevolent smile, taking the letter lightly. “May the vague light be enough to guide you back safely. And beware the poisonous ivy.” The moment he shut the door and turned, his apprentice was already perched on the front windowsill, watching the knight struggle to remember the way he came with sadistic satisfaction.

	<p> “I fail to understand why the Spellbound is the only one to get magic. Simply due to being ‘chosen’, they get to have all the power their hearts desire? How is that acceptable? What if they were to be a sociopath? What would we do then? Queen Eira doesn’t deserve such a position.” His apprentice mused. She watched the knight disappear from view into the thick fog, his footsteps far out of earshot. 

	<p> “Quiet,” he sternly chastised. “Queen Eira can protect Elipsum-Ckye better than any human could, Junip or not. Her power is the only reason we’re safe from the demons. No one has the right to doubt her abilities, let alone take her power for their own. Am I understood?”

	<p> “Yes, sir. Sorry, sir,” she meekly replied whilst he opened the letter swiftly with one nail prying up the wax sealing. It read: <br>
<em> To my dear friend, <br>
	As you likely know, ‘Killjoy’ has been a terror to the Central Kingdom for a decade now, and his recent incline of activity is causing distress among my people. I cannot expend myself on chasing him down any more than I am now. You are fully cognizant of my disapproval of Junipary, however in this case it is far better than to let that man run rampant, killing innocent people with nothing to show for it except his own sick idea of merriment. We know nothing of the man aside from pale skin and blond hair that you described to me. Any help you are willing to extend would be greatly appreciated. <br>
	Also, if you could send some Aquilegia Caerulea seeds for my palace garden, I would love that. I know they grow in abundance on the rocky cliff side shores of the Western Crest. <br>
	Sincerely, Eira <br>
Post statement: I hope you are doing well; it has been a while since our last rendezvous. Please let me know when the next time we can meet up for tea is. </em>

	<p> The man glanced to his apprentice, “Likewise, I have no altercation with someone as good-natured as Eira being in power.” He set the letter down on the table. “I have a job for you, my apprentice. Go find me some Aquilegia Caerulea seeds.”

	<p> Her excitement for having a task quickly faded at the sound of unfamiliar words. “Pardon?”

	<p> “Rocky Mountain Columbines. They grow by the beaches among the rocks. Be safe,” he told her as she grabbed her coat and a satchel to skip excitedly out the door. He takes his seat at the tea table once more, readying his ink and pen. 

<p> <em> Queen Eira, <br>
	I’m glad to see you taking up interest in having diverse flora within your garden as I suggested in our last visit. I will most gladly meet your request. <br>
	I am doing wonderfully. Life is fairly quiet here, although my apprentice does provide a challenge for my peaceful living. She is often too excited about Junipary. Likewise, I hope that everything is going wonderfully on your side of the country. We will have to get together again soon, most definitely. <br>
	In complete transparency, I am quite jaded with Killjoy, having dealt with him before. He is certainly not pleasant. If you believe my proverbs to be incomprehensible at times, attempt to comprehend his wordings. It’s nearly impossible to parse his psychotic ramblings. However, I will try once more to speak sense to him for you or at least get him to remain still long enough to restrain him. And you know me; I would not resort to Junipary until necessary. </em>


 		<p style="text-align:center"> 4 </p>


	<p> In the center of it all, a median between all the kingdoms lies an urban oasis amidst the chaos of its surroundings. The rather lazily named Central Kingdom was home to the majority of the population of Elipsum-Ckye, most finding the more human saturated area an amenity. Those born here infrequently, if ever, leave due to the luxuries and placidity of their routinely life. The sun shining down made the wind pleasant, friends were frequent and reliable, and anything required was easily transported and sold nearby. Leaving was unnecessary and often believed to simply be a move of inexplicable desire.

	<p> A light gust of wind caressed the earth, lightly stirring the dust across the worn roads. It flowed through the bustling marketplace of people, presenting a pleasant, refreshing atmosphere for those busy with shopping. The gust bellowed a man’s travel cloak, his hand quickly coming up to tug the hood back over his head, concealing his identity within shadow. When the wind calmed, the worn edges of his mantle heeled at the ankles of his boots. 

	<p> He kept his gaze to the dusty road, walking at a brisk pace and narrowly avoiding colliding shoulders with others as he weaved through the marketplace. He cast a fleeting glance to the corners where shadows hissed their contempt for humankind, yet were pitifully stymied from acting upon their threats. He huffed softly under his breath but kept moving, ignoring any sidelong glances in his direction. 

	<p> He stopped in front of a stone merchant’s stand. He quickly gestured to stone and cement powder. “90 kilograms and the powder needed respectively,” the man said, his voice surprisingly amiable for his suspicious appearance. The man then brought a hand up, clenched around an old, canvas coin bag, dropping it on the table. “I believe this to be more than enough,” he spoke again. The merchant eyed the man warily, not setting her gaze away as she poured the coins from the canvas bag. They clattered against the wooden stand, falling into rest quickly. The merchant slowly lowered her gaze to count the coin and away from the man who stood unmoving. Her finger trailing over each one, touching the symbol that graced each E-Ckyan coin; a symbol that few could even historically comprehend anymore, yet all recognized it for what it was. 

	<p> Once she was satisfied with the amount, she gave a nod of approval. “Plenty,” she assured, shifting to collect all but four of the shimmery pieces. She dropped the coins into her own coin bag, then scouted around briefly, “Are you intending to carry this all?” She questioned incredulously.

	<p> He shook his head. He brought two fingers to his lips and whistled loudly. A palomino Clydesdale stallion trotted up, fully tacked with saddle bags, snorting once it stopped and shaking its mane. The woman blinked in shock having not expected a steed as magnificent as that to come at the man’s call. Though it took the merchant a moment, she came to and began loading the man’s order into the saddle bags. After, he led the horse by the underside of its muzzle, walking in the direction of the town. 

	<p> “This job will hopefully only be a day or two of work, Purmius.” The man said, and though regarding his steed by name, it was more like words of comfort to himself. His footsteps felt heavy by the time he reached the outer edge of the town, passing the last of the houses. He paused at the gates of the palace. The guards glared at him, but when he pulled his hood down, they reluctantly granted entry. Their eyes warily stared him down until he was out of sight, trailing through the front gardens. 

	<p> He visited the royal stable, finding an empty stall for the steed to find rest within. He petted the stallion’s mane, giving a small pat before pulling the halter off. “Rest now, Purmius. Your work is done. Although mine is only beginning.” 

	<p> With a heave and a struggle, the man eventually managed to pull the saddle bags off and onto the shavings below. He huffed as he finished removing the tack from Purmius and setting it on the tack bars. He made haste for the doors to the palace, taking a deep breath as he stopped in front of the two knights who eyed him like a pariah. After all, seeing shadow demons wasn’t any sane man’s issue. 

	<p> “Morning,” he greeted politely as he flashed his ID to them. They curtly nodded and pulled open the grandiose double doors. Since they made no effort to wait for him before beginning to shut the doors once again, he dashed awkwardly past them into the palace. He strode through the halls, his boots clicking against the polished marble and reverberating off the walls. He knew these halls well enough as the royal architect to find his way to the throne room where the queen sat calmly, speaking with her advisor. 

	<p> Her light mauve eyes flicked up when she noticed the soft knock on the door. “You may enter,” her melodic voice beckoned. When the man entered, a smile graced her face, “Good morning, Perthran, did Purmius serve you well?”

	<p> “Greetings and salutations, Lady Eira,” he replied, sweeping a foot over the other and bending in respect. “He did his job perfectly, and I have all the supplies needed for the construction of the fountain.”

	<p> “Splendid. Do begin as soon as possible, if you may. I am quite ecstatic for this addition to the gardens,” she said. 

	<p> “Immediately, of course.”

	<p> By the time the sun stretched directly above the Central Kingdom, the fountain’s foundation had been completed. Though the summer heat and the shadows cursing at him from their hiding places under the trees and brush made the process more grueling than needed to be. Sounds of footsteps make Calak Perthran glance up from his work.

	<p> “Lady Eira,” he smiled. “What brings you out here, if I may ask?” 

	<p> She flashed a meek smile, holding up a tray of an assortment of tea items: a kettle filled with iced tea, biscuits placed neatly in a basket, sugar cubes, and two cups. “I presumed you might enjoy a moment of reprieve.” 

	<p> His eyes trailed from the tray back to her face, then to the fountain’s foundation. “That’s quite considerate of you,” he chirped with a nod of his head. She set the tray down, sitting delicately upon the fountain’s stone foundation. He sat down on the opposite side of the tray, swiping his hands clean of dust. He had purposely kept a decent meter or two away out of sensitivity of his own diaphoretic state. 

	<p> She poured them cool tea, then glanced up at him. “You need not sit so far. A little sweat does not bother me. It only proves your assiduousness. Besides, I would appreciate a break from having to act so perfect.”

	<p> “I suppose that makes sense,” he responded, though he did not move closer still out of respect. He took a sip of the tea, recognizing it immediately as Chrysanthemum. The coolness spread through his chest, causing a soft sigh of relief to escape from his lips. A comfortable silence fell over them, the gentle swaying of the plants and trees around them providing a placating effect. The wind carried a sweet song, the earth seemed to still a moment as the queen and her friend silently enjoyed each other’s presence.

	<p> Eventually, his voice opened the silence, “So, how has your day been?”

	<p> “Fine, I suppose.” 

	<p> Though he detected from her tone the underlying fatigue. Gently, he spoke, glancing to her eyes, “I asked because I was interested in your day. Though if it’s confidential you may say just that.”

	<p> “No, not confidential,” she replied. She hardly noticed the smile that contorted onto her face. “I am simply a little drained from playing detective, so to say.”

	<p> “Whatever do you mean, Milady?”

	<p> “There was a recent murder in the city. They wish for me to look into it personally, which is not exactly an issue in the sense that I am more than willing to extend my services. Truly, that is the only reason I am here for, to protect Elipsum-Ckye. No, the issue is with the fact that I am simply not skilled in such work. Judging intentions from unknown sources and scrutinizing the finest of details is not my strong suit.”

	<p> Calak shuddered at the mere thought, “A murder? That’s horrifying. Do you have any idea who the culprit might be?”

	<p> “I cannot tell for sure, though I have a premonition that it is Killjoy. I feel as though he has been getting comfortable in this game of his. Though we have no concrete evidence that this murder was done by him.”

	<p> “Hmm, I don’t think I’m much help here. The very thought of heartless murder and gore makes me queasy. But I believe you’ll figure it out, Lady Eira. You doubt yourself too much. You’re very resourceful. Just try not to stress too much, it will certainly only make things worse for yourself.”

	<p> “Thank you, Perthran. Your words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.” She paused to take a sip of her own tea, then spoke again, “Anyway, how has your day been?”

	<p> “Fine,” he shrugged with a playful smirk on his face.

	<p> “I might have brought that upon myself,” she scoffed in amusement.

	<p> He broke out into a soft laugh. “Well, I think the sun is closer to Earth than usual today, but regardless, I’m quite ecstatic for this fountain. I was wondering when you’d let me add it for almost two years.”

	<p> He neglected to tell her the troubles he’s had with the shadows. He found it onerous enough that most of the town believed him to be mentally ill. He did not wish for her to cast him those same oblique glares that he often endured. Regardless of whether the figures genuinely existed, they were real to his own eyes and ears. He didn’t need another to tell him what he had been tormented by since birth was just his own mind’s cruel jest. 

	<p> “It is quite warm today,” she mused aloud, rousing him from his thoughts. “Do stay cool. I would hate for you to get ill from heat stroke.”

	<p> “Of course, Milady. I appreciate your concern,” he responded with a slow nod of his head. 

	<p> “I shall leave you to your work. Thank you for providing me with a much needed break,” she said whilst she rose to her feet. She swept the platter of tea things into a hand that splayed across the bottom. She knelt slightly to allow him to place his cup back onto it. Though not even giving her chance to stop him, he swiftly took the salver into his own arms.

	<p> “Allow me, my Queen,” he said simply, though awaited a reply before even taking another step. 

	<p> She gave a single nod of her head, “A gentleman as always, Perthran.”

	<p> The remainder of his workday went on no disparate than previous. By the end, he found himself to be enervated. The refreshing shower he took after brought much relief, though only sleep alone could fully revivify him. He strode quietly through the corridors, his gaze on the marble floors. Though the sound of his name made all his thoughts come to a screeching halt as he jerked his head up. Any hesitation and he would have collided with her. 

	<p> “Milady-! S-sorry about that. I was just… thinking, I suppose,” he muttered. He would be lying if he said he was merely caught off guard by her presence. 

	<p> “It is quite alright. I was coming out in hopes you had not already resided to your quarters for the evening,” she admitted. “I wished to tell you good evening, and I hope you find pleasant rest tonight.”

	<p> “Thank you,” he spoke, quiet. “I wish all the same to you, Milady.” 

	<p> He knew her wishes were in vain, though saying that would just give her reason to worry, and he’d rather not that. He could already hear the shadows laughing gleefully as the sun finished passing the horizon. He was their first target, as always.
